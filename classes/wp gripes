There are issues with your plugin code.


All plugins must have unique function printaura_names, namespaces, defines, and classnames. This prevents your plugin from conflicting with other plugins or themes. We need you to update your plugin to use more unique and distinct names.

## pre_fix 

Similarly, don't use __ (double underscores), wp_ , or _ (single underscore) as a prefix. Those are reserved for WordPress itself. You can use them inside your classes, but not as stand-alone function.

Some examples from your plugin:

function printaura_get_web_page
class Printaura_JSONAPIHelpers 
class Printaura_WooCommerce_JSON_API_Result 

## Including your own CURL code

WordPress comes with an extensive HTTP API that should be used instead of creating your own curl calls. It’s both faster and more extensive. It’ll fall back to curl if it has to, but it’ll use a lot of WordPress’ native functionality first.

## Allowing Direct File Access to plugin files
You can avoid this by putting this code at the top of all php files:

if ( ! defined( 'ABSPATH' ) ) exit; // Exit if accessed directly
